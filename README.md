# MultisigNFT
ERC-721 Multisignature NFT

This was originally a project for a hackathon that I competed in, however, I ran out of time in order to submit a working, complete project.

## What is included?

This is a monorepo that includes the MultisigNFT smart contract and parts of a web front-end dashboard of sorts that is supposed to allow the user to interact with the smart contract indirectly and manage all the multisig NFTs that are owned by their private keys.

## Is this Project Complete?

No, it's not complete, doesn't have all the features I want it to have, and it currently does not work. Feel free to submit a pull request with any fixes/modifications you make.
